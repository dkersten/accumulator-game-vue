# accumulator-game-vue

## About the Project
The accumulator game is a silly game where you can make money by clicking a dollar bill and by purchasing and upgrading businesses. You are able to compare your fake wealth to real people's net worth and "buy" real luxury properties.

You can play a version [here](https://accumulator-game.netlify.app/).

And if you're impatient you can play a version with a ton of starting money [here](https://accumulator-game-cheaty-version.netlify.app/).
