# accumulator-game-vue

## About the Project
The accumulator game is a silly game where you can make money by clicking a dollar bill and by purchasing and upgrading businesses. You are able to compare your fake wealth to real people's net worth and "buy" real luxury properties.

You can play a version [here](https://accumulator-game.netlify.app/).

And if you're impatient you can play a version with a ton of starting money [here](https://accumulator-game-cheaty-version.netlify.app/). Note this version does not have the real world people richest list.

## Roadmap

I intend to continue iterating on this project. Initially I plan to:

- Add near real time updates to the real people net worth list
- Allow you to sell buinesses back
- Bulk purchase properties and upgrades
- Disallow purchasing multiple "real world" properties where it doesn't make sense (i.e. can't buy the same sports team twice)

Long term I'd like to implement a feature allowing you to pick up where you left off if you close the game.

Enjoy playing!
